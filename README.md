## About

This is the second project of the FWD initiative on udacity. 
It discusses:
- Javascript asyncrouns code.
- Creating and dealing with node.js express server.
- Dealing with open APIs  

And the final output is a website where you can enter your zip code, and it goes to fetch the weather temperature for your city.
It sends it to an express server to save it there, and then fetch it to display it to you.
